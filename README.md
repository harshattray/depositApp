## Basic Overview

Built using React and Typescript and Styled-Components.

Interms of the design implementation, I've taken the liberty to showcase the use of styled components(in the Login page component) and normal sass implementation (in the dashboard), just to showcase two diverse approaches.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.
